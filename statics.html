			<li>Andrew Daramola: “I that gum can be a huge battle. I think that it’s something that  I rather not worry about, like if people could just like chew gum and it wouldn’t end up on like desk and chairs and stuff. I’d actually have no problem with it. I think that like that it can help people , I heard the things about like gum, helping people like think and process, but like unfortablebly a lot of times it ends up all over the place and when that happens you gotta ban gum. So like if people, I I don’t mind it, so I’m gonna say no we shouldn’t banned it, but if it comes to that point then we got to get rid it”.</li>

			<li>Adriana Alfaro: “Yes, I do it in class, because it helps me concentrate and I usually get bored and hungry”.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Victor Alfaro: “I say no. The reason why is cuz when you , what do you call it, if anything when people don’t wanna get up then they would just put it under their desk instead of throwing it in the trash”.</li>

			<li>Marisela Gonzales: “Yes, I think it should because it’s fun to chew”.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Ashley Gonzales: “Do I think, yes I do because well for me I just like to chew it, so I need to chew it”.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Donald Puathasnanon: “I’m okay with gum chewing as long as it’s not loud, like people aren’t snapping and people are throwing it away properly. Not under tables and stuff like that, so I have no problem with it.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Hailey Reyes: “Yes, because I concentrate more when I’m chewing gum, I don’t get as distracted”.</li>
